# How to use:
1. Open your preferred batch terminal - for example, CMD.
2. Navigate to the directory. For example, `cd C:\Users\User\Documents\Code`.
3. Run 
```batch
curl -o batch.bat -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sammeeeeeeee/Output-all-contents-of-files-in-directory/main/batch.bat && cmd /c batch.bat
```
It will list all the files in your directory in a numbered list. Select the files you want by entering the numbers, with a space in between. It will then output the contents of the file and offer to save it. Select `y` to save it to results.txt in your chosen directory, or `n` to exit. It will then delete the downloaded script and exit.
